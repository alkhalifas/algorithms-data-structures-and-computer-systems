# TODO Please edit the following information in your assignment

- Name: *Saleh Alkhalifa*
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? *~3 hours - mostly debugging loops.*
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? *No*
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - *[Needed to pass an array in a function](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-arrays-functions*)
  - *[Needed to generate a random number](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/random/srand)*
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? *Getting a chance to sit down and explore C. It really is an amazing language, and makes you realize how abstract Python really is.*
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? *Remove the creating of a linux virtual environment. It causes too much chaos given everyones computers are differnet, and not all VM software works the same way.*

# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Note: Your code **must** compile and run on the Khoury machines. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* Note: You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* And do not forget, if we do not see your most recent changes 'pushed into this repository' (i.e. what you see on github.com), then we cannot grade them. Updates to the repository must be before the assignment deadline!
