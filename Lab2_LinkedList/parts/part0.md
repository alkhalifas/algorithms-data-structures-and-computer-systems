# Part 0 - How to SSH and git pull

1. First open a terminal and ssh into the Khoury servers ``` ssh khoury_user_name_here@login.khoury.neu.edu ```
2. Navigate to your Monorepo directory(Use the `cd` command to change directory, `ls` to see files, and `pwd` to see your path)
3. When you are within your Monorepo, do a ```git pull```. This will add all of the files I have previously pushed into your repositories.

## Troubleshooting

- If for some reason you are having troubles, you can always create a new copy of your monorepo by running `git clone https://github.com/COURSENAME/monorepo-yourUserNameHere` in a separate directory.
- If you have trouble doing a 'git pull' because of a *personal authentication token* (PAT), then this may help: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
