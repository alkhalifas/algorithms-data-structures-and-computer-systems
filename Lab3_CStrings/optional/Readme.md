An optional, ungraded activity.

Take a look at the 'dynamic_string' type in this example. I spent a little bit of time thinking what a 'string type' may look like in C, or how we might want to use it. Regardless, this code may be interesting to look at, and to think about what a 'native string' type would look like, and how it would have to behave.
