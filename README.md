## Using the Monorepo to get help

One awesome thing about having all of your code in github, is that you can share a link to the course staff to specific source files when you need help. So when posting to piazza:

1. Share a link to your code (Don't worry, the repositories are private, so other students cannot access your code).
2. Make sure to push any changes made--anything you see online is what we will also see.

## Partners Spreadsheet
(For working in teams on assignments)

*Note: You do not have to work with a partner (and you can switch if you choose after each assignment), but if you choose to, you may use this sheet to help faciliate finding a partner by reaching out to their email on the sheet. Consider having a partner as fully optional in this class. The Assignment workload is designed to be completed individually.
