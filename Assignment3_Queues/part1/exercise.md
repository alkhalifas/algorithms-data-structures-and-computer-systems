Why is a ring buffer useful and/or when should it be used?

Circular Queues, Circular Buffers, or Ring Buffers are are a type of data structure allowing us to implement a first-in-first-out ordering. In essence, we can think of ring buffers as a list or array in a circular fashion in which the maximum size or capacity of the instance is known.
