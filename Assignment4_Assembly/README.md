- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? *I really enjoyed having the freedom to write code without a header file and other contrains, and being able to explore and implement things based on what I learned so far.*
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? *If you could provide an extra-credit opportunity to include more instructions, and 'real-world' practices on quantifying cycles, that would be appreciated!*

# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Note: Your code **must** compile and run on the Khoury machines. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* Note: You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* And do not forget, if we do not see your most recent changes 'pushed into this repository' (i.e. what you see on github.com), then we cannot grade them. Updates to the repository must be before the assignment deadline!
