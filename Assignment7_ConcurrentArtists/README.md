- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? I liked being able to see the little artists draw! It was adorable!
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? It would be great to conver the process of drawing into a gif, perhaps by capturing each step as an output and compiling them together to create an animation.

# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.
