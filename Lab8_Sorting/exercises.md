# Exercises

1. What do you think the Big-O (worst-case) complexity of this algorithm is? 
2. What do you think the best-case complexity of this algorithm is? 
	- Note-- assume you do not have any information about if the array is already sorted or not.
3. Does selection sort require any additional storage beyond the original array? 
	- i.e. Did you have to allocate any extra memory to perform the sort?
5. Would the Big-O complexity change if we used a linked list instead of an array?

## Answers:

1. *The Insertion Sort algorithm perfoms are $O(n^2)$ $e^{i \pi} = -1$ complexity for both average and worst case scenarios because it builds the final sorted array one item at a time. This algorithm is relatively less efficient or larger lists relative to some of its other counterparts such as Quick Sort. *
