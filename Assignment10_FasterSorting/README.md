# TODO Please edit the following information in your assignment

- Name: Saleh Alkhalifa
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? This one was tougher than the others, because there was a great deal of logic invovled here relative to some of the other ones we had completed. I needed to refer to some documentation online for some guidance, especially on the splitting and sorting portion.
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? No, but I did refer to some items on Piazza posted by Juan.
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - [MergeSort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort)
  - [MergeSort PsudoCode](https://hackr.io/blog/merge-sort-in-c)
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? I did not particularly like this assignment as I found myself referring to the two sources above more often that I had wanted to. I generally try to give assignments a few reasonable approaches without any guidance or assistance, but this one was particularly difficult. Now that I have completed it, I definitely appreciate and respect the logic behind the algorithm, its quite fascinating to see how it works.
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? Some additional guidance (pesudocode) would be appreciated. I realize that it might give away a considerable amount of the answers, but I think being able to have a framework to build off of would be more beneficial to my learning.

# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.
